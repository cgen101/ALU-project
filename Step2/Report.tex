\section{Introduction}
In this project, we implemented essential components of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). First, we coded 4-bit binary logic functions, including AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, XNOR, and NOT, as well as a 2x4-bit input/output shifter. We then implemented 4-bit arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, integrating carry-in and carry-out circuits for extended accuracy. We included an extra 4-bit output for multiplication and division remainders.

Next, we tested each circuit's functionality to ensure expected behavior, followed by generating simulation waveforms to visually confirm the ALUâ€™s performance. Finally, we compiled our work and observations into a comprehensive report, which summarizes the methods, results, and key insights gained from the project.

\section{2x4 Shift Circuit}
\label{sec:headings}

The 2x4 shift circuit takes a 4-bit input and shifts the bits left or right by up to two positions, depending on the control signal. Each shift moves the bits in the input to adjacent positions, and the vacant bits are filled with zeros. Shifting by one or two positions allows for additional flexibility in data manipulation, making the circuit versatile in operations where both single and double shifts are required.
\subsection{Shift Circuit Verilog Code}
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{2x4Shifter/shift_tb.v}

To test the Shift circuit we have created 3 input registers, and 1 output. Input A is 4bits, being the input that we want to shift, next input, amt, is 2 bits, being the amount that we want to shift A by, and the last input, dir, is the direction we want to shift, being 0 for left and 1 for right. It will then output the resulting shifted bits into Y, and we will know if its working correctly if Y is a shifted version of A in the direction and the amount specified.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{2x4Shifter/shift_tb.v}


\subsection{Shift Circuit Waveforms}

At 10 ns, we can see that A is 1010, amt is 01 (1), and dir is 0 (left), so the output Y is 0100.

    \caption{Shift Circuit with marker at 10ns}
    \label{fig:shift-wave1}
\end{figure}

At 20 ns, we can see that A is 1010, amt is 10 (2), and dir is 0 (left), so the output Y is 1000.

    \label{fig:shift-wave2}
\end{figure}

At 30 ns, we can see that A is 1010, amt is 01 (1), and dir is 1 (right), so the output Y is 0101.

\section{Not Circuit}
The Not circuit takes one input A, with an output Y. This will output a 0 if A is a 1, and will output 1 if A is a 0.



\subsection{Not Circuit Verilog Code}
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Not/not_gate.v}

To test the Not circuit, we have created one register A, as well as a wire Y. This way we are able to take each input for A and test output for A=0 and A=1. We'll know if this is working correctly if Y returns 1 for the test where A is 0 and Y returns 0 when A is 1.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Not/not_tb.v}

\subsection{Not Circuit Waveform}
At 0 ns, we can see that A is the 0h(0000), so the output Y is Fh(1111).

To test the And circuit, we have created two registers A and B, as well as a wire Y. We then create a for loop to produce all 16 possible values for A and B. We will know that our And circuit is behaving as expected if Y produces correct values for all combinations of A and B. For example, if A=0001 and B=0001, the expected result for Y is 0001.

\section{Addition Circuit}
The Addition circuit takes two 4-bit inputs A and B along with a 1-bit carry in to extend the output range from 15 to 31. The circuitâ€™s outputs include  a 4-bit output called Sum, along with a 1-bit carry out to accommodate the extended range. The has an intermediary 5-bit variable, full sum, which is used to extract carry out and partial sum. First the full sum is found by adding A, B, and carry in. Then, Sum is assigned to the 4 lower bits of full sum. Then, carry out is assigned to the 5th bit of full sum. 
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Addition/addition.v}

To test the Addition circuit, we have created two registers A and B, a register carry in, a wire Sum, and a wire carry out. We then perform 5 tests with A, B, and carry in at various values. We will know that the Addition circuit is working as expected if carry out plus Sum produces correct results for every combination of A, B, and carry in that we have tested. For example, if A is 1000, B is 1000, and carry in is 1 , then the expected result: Sum is 0001, carry out is 1 for a decimal value of 17.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Addition/addition_tb.v}
\subsection{Addition Circuit Waveform} 

At 2ns, A is 1 and B is 2, so Sum is 3 with  carry in and carry out at 0.

\section{Multiplication Circuit}
The Multiplication circuit takes two 4-bit inputs A and B, and produces two 4-bit outputs, product low and product high, representing the high and low 4 bits of the product of A and B. The circuit has an intermediary 8-bit variable, full product, which is used to extract the low and high 4 bits of the product. First, full product is assigned to the product of A and B. Then, product low is assigned the first 4 bits of full product. Then, product high is assigned the last 4 bits of full product. 
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Multiplication/multiplication.v} 

To test the Multiplication circuit, we have created two registers A and B,and two wires product low and product high. We then perform 5 tests with A and B at various values. We will know that the Multiplication circuit is working as expected if product low, product high produces correct results for every combination of A times B that we have tested. For example, if A is 1111 and B is 1111, then the expected result: product high is 1110, product low is 0001 for a decimal value of 225.
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Multiplication/multiplication_tb.v}
\subsection{Multiplication Circuit Waveform}

For example, if A is 1111 and B is 1111, then the expected result: Y is 0000
\lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Subtraction/subtraction_tb.v}
\subsection{Subtraction Circuit Waveform}

 \section{Division Circuit}
 The Division circuit takes two 4-bit inputs A and B, and produces two 4-bit outputs, quotient (Q) and remainder (R). The circuit first calculates how many times B can go into A, becoming Q, then it takes Q amount of B's away from A and the resulting number is R.
 \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Division/division.v} 
 
 To test the Division circuit, we have created two registers A and B,and two wires quotient (Q) and remainder (R). We then perform 5 tests with A and B at various values. We will know that the Division circuit is working as expected if quotient and remainder produces correct results for every combination of A times B that we have tested. 
 \lstinputlisting[language=Verilog]{Division/division_tb.v}
 \subsection{Multiplication Circuit Waveform} 
 
 At 0ns, A is 0 and B is 1, so the quotient is 0 and the remainder is also 0.

\section{Conclusion}

This project introduced the design and testing of a basic 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). We coded essential logic functions like AND, OR, and NOT, along with shifting operations, which are crucial for handling binary data. We also developed basic arithmetic operationsâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divisionâ€”which included handling carries and remainders to ensure accurate results.

Testing the circuits and generating waveforms confirmed that our ALU worked correctly across different inputs. This process highlighted the importance of both accuracy in coding and thorough testing. Overall, the project has been valuable for understanding digital circuits and the structure of an ALU, preparing us for more advanced digital logic design.
